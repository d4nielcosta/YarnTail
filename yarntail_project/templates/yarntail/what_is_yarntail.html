        <h1>What Is YarnTail?</h1>
    </div>


    <p>

        Confused? Your in the right place! YarnTail is a website for people who knit, and want to browse and share
        knitting<br> patterns on the internet.<br/> <br/>


        Unlike other knitting websites, <strong>YarnTail does not limit you to photos and typed instructions in order to<br>
        represent knitting patterns. </strong><br/><br/>
        Pattern input is performed through an easy to use interface that represents your patterns as a graph. Cool, right? <br/>
        (Instructions on how to upload new patterns can be found <a href="{% url 'upload_instructions' %}"> here</a>, by
        the way.)<br>
        The pattern is then taken and converted into data that we can store on our servers.

        <br/><br/>
        When you want to look at a pattern, we take that data (knits, purls, colored yarn) and reconstruct the graph<br>
        representation for you to view. The end result is shown below:
